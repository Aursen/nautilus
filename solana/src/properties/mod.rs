/// Basically, if a struct implements this trait, that means its built using one or more `Box` pointers to
/// accounts passed into the program, ie. `Box<AccountInfo<'_>>`

/// the Nautilus source library.

    /// its best effort to return the account most closely associated with the object in question.
